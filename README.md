# Live-results-streaming with bonus

Description

You need to create:

• football matches end result generator (match-end-result-generator)

• service for sinking results to relational database (match-end-result-sinking-service)

match-end-result-generator needs to be developed in python, with a help of python generators.
It can be started through terminal with command like syntax.

Schema of match-end-result-event is following:

{matchId : uuidv4,

matchName: string,

endResult: string}

Example would be {“matchId”: “8657ad85-5b62-4892-bbbe-2c56c93d525f”,
“matchName”: “Manchester United – Zrinjski”, “endResult”: ”1 : 2”}

Match name should be randomly generated from list of football club names. 10 names is enough.
End result should also be generated randomly with max number of goals per team be 7.

Generator should run endlessly and should generate match-end-result-event every second.
After every event generation, generator should send match-end-result-event on match-end-resultsinking-service.
match-end-result-sinking-service needs to accept messages and insert them to database (MySql or
Postgress). It should be developed in Java as a Spring Boot application.

Communication between services should be HTTP, match-end-result-generator should use HTTP
POST method for sending match-end-result-event to match-end-result-sinking-service.


You should spin up database with help of docker container using docker-compose. Docker compo
file needs to be in code repository.


**Bonus points**

In match-end-result-sinking-service save match-end-result-event in Java thread safe memory
structure like ConcurrentHashMap, spin up a separate thread using java’s ExecutorService that w
check for match-end-result-event in memory structure and insert to database if any exist. After ev
is inserted in database remove saved event form memory structure.
